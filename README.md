## Summary

The highest rate of utilization of the bike sharing service in New York City is by subscribers that ride a bike during weekdays in the morning and in the evening. This pattern indicates that this service is being utilized as a way of commuting to/from work.

It would be helpful to perform additional visualizations with this dataset:
- Analyze data from different months during the Winter and Summer.
- Analyze how many bikes are in each station and determine if there are periods when there are no bikes left to be rented, in order to identify the offer and demand for this service.
